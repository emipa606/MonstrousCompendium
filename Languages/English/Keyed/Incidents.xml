  <Deviljholetter>A Deviljho have entered the area. They will roam the region, hunting everything in the area.\n\nThey can't pass doors, so if you stay behind walls you should be safe. They won't attack inactive turrets, so turn your turrets off if you want to save them.\n\nThey'll leave the area in a few days.</Deviljholetter>
